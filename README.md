# Security Analysis *WIP*
Analyzation of massive data scrape/leak from intelx.io, stored on my private server, but potentially reallocated here eventually. We'll see...

Also the status of people I know and how bad their security was will be in [this text document](https://github.com/2lag/Security-Analysis/blob/main/viewers.txt).

Stay tuned for some cool analytical graphs and stuff :D
