# Security Analysis *WIP*
Analyzation of massive data scrape/leak (~87,000 files) from intelx.io, stored on my private server, ~~but potentially reallocated here eventually.~~ We'll see...

Also the status of people I know and how bad their security was will be in [this text document](https://github.com/2lag/Security-Analysis/blob/main/viewers.txt).

Stay tuned for some cool analytical graphs and stuff :D




##### ***UPDATE AS OF 3/29/22***
     902 combolists extracted totalling 86.889708 megabytes, or 86889708 individual characters, of textual data from the ~8,500 .txt files  I've gone through so far.
     Nearing the 10% mark slowly but surely!
          -(username:password or email/username/password)

     Raw data will not be reallocated here for legality concerns. (See "Password Trafficking")
     Instead, it will remain on my server, and only the information/graphs RELATED to this data will be updated/displayed here.
