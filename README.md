# Security Analysis *WIP*
Analyzation of massive data scrape/leak (~87,000 files) from [intelx.io](https://intelx.io), stored on my private server, ~~but potentially reallocated here eventually. We'll see...~~ (see update for reasoning as to why this is crossed out)

Also the status of people I know and how bad their security was will be in [this text document](https://github.com/2lag/Security-Analysis/blob/main/viewers.txt).

Stay tuned for some cool analytical graphs and stuff :D




##### ***UPDATE AS OF 3/29/22***
     902 combolists extracted totalling 86.889708 megabytes, or 86889708 individual characters, of textual data from the ~8,500 .txt files  I've gone through so far.
     Nearing the 10% mark slowly but surely!
          -(username:password or email/username/password)

     Raw data will not be reallocated here for legality concerns. (See "Password Trafficking")
     Instead, it will remain on my server, and only the information/graphs RELATED to this data will be updated/displayed here.

##### **UPDATE AS OF 5/21/22***
     I was actually making decent progress on the total amount of files I had completed going through, but I had recently recieved a call from my ISP saying they were   contacted by a "third party" about my RBPi (Raspberry Pi) file server, as I had made it publicly available for one of my friends to download some video game footage I had recorded. Through this, all of the breaches were made available, however, they were inaccessible unless someone already had the IP. My best guess is that someone was doing some google "dorking", and was browsing for sites that were IP addresses intending to look for file servers/publicly accessible cameras and whatnot, and somehow stumbled onto my file server, and from there, reported it. Or it was just the NSA/FBI spying or something, who knows. (Besides Doug from my ISP...) 
     Anyways, this will be concluding my project in the public eye, I'll continue to work in private on it after I take my server down and unencrypt the files, and I will post the final results here in due time.
